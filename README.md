Zalmat et al. 2021 American Journal of Botany Data submission

3 files are included:

File 1-genotype_probability_matrix_Zalmat_et_al_2021_AJB.csv
	This file contains a genotype probability matrix used in the Zalmat et al. 2021 American Journal of Botany publication. The matrix contains individuals as rows, and genetic loci as columns. The data are genotype probabilities as measured using the population genetics program ENTROPY. Genotype probabilities were averaged across runs of K.

File 2- indiv_ids.csv
	This file contains individual ids for each plant sampled in the study. It gives the population name (three letter ID) and the individual number within that population.
	
File 3- Iris_AZ_coords.csv
	This file contains gps coordinates for all sampled localities (population ids from indiv_ids.csv). The data are given as lattitude and longitude.
